## About The Project

The majority of today's centralised creator platforms deduct a sizable portion of the money producers are paid, consequently decreasing their profitability. To address this issue, we developed a decentralised subscription-based streaming service that allows users to access the material of their favourite creators by purchasing an exclusive NFT and paying a monthly membership fee.

## Built With

Following technologies and libraries are used for the development of this website

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)
- [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance)
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com)
- [Truffle Suite](https://trufflesuite.com)

## Getting Started

To setup the project locally the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Please make sure you have [metamask](https://metamask.io/) installed and connected to polygon's mumbai testnet and have some test matic in your wallet

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

```sh
  # Homebrew
  brew install nodejs

  # Sudo apt
  sudo apt install nodejs

  # Packman
  pacman -S nodejs

  # Module Install
  dnf module install nodejs:<stream> # stream is the version

  # Windows (chocolaty)
  cinst nodejs.install

```

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

```sh
  # Homebrew
  brew install git

  # Sudo apt
  apt-get install git

  # Packman
  pacman -S git

  # Module Install (Fedora)
  dnf install git

```


### Running the project.

The project uses NPM. It is strictly advised to stick with NPM so as to avoid dependency conflicts down the line.

```
## Checkout into the project client directory
cd client

## Install Dependencies
npm install

## Run the Project
npm start

```

Following are the commands to remove/add new dependencies using yarn

```
## Add a new Package
npm install <package-name>

## Remove an existing Package
npm uninstall <package-name>

## Save Package as a Dev Dependency
npm install <package-name> --save-dev
```

## Features

### Decentralized subscription-based streaming

Most centralized creator platforms today take away a huge cut of the pay received by the creators thereby reducing their profits. We have tried to solve this problem by creating a decentralized subscription-based streaming service where audiences can access their favorite creatorâ€™s content by buying an exclusive NFT and paying a subscription fee.

### Livepeerâ€™s decentralized protocol

Transcoding properly for video streaming has become quite expensive in an era where video streaming uses 80% of all Internet bandwidth. But thanks to the decentralised Livepeer protocol, which not only helps to cut costs by up to 50 times but also offers streaming with appropriate transcoding.

### Alchemyâ€™s NFT API

Traditional authentication systems demand a lot of time-consuming steps, such as several logins and 2FAs. Your cryptocurrency wallet serves as both your identity and a one-click process at Mystiq. Additionally, we are grateful for Alchemy's NFT API, which enables us to verify whether a user has the necessary NFT in order to access a Creator's work.

### SuperFluid's Money Streaming tool

The administration of payments has frequently caused problems. We can stream and transfer money easily with a single click thanks to SuperFluid's Money Streaming tool. Additionally, managing your team members and paying them on time might be a hassle and reduce your productivity. We resolve this issue by allocating the money earned by the creator to the members of its team utilising the Instant Distribution method of SuperFluid.

## Future Scope

* We will create and use our own token in place of Superfluid to lessen its dependence and multiply revenue tenfold.
* A content developer is the best person to understand their target consumers and subjects. Along with the money, we will provide creators complete control over the platform that hosts their platform. We'll also provide users with the option to customize their platforms to suit their needs.
